# DL-from-scratch 
In this project, I implemented ANNs from scratch without any built-in libraries.

For each model, we apply it for learning the decision boundary of a 2D 2-class data set and then to classify between cats and dogs images.

The data set used for the deep ANN training is the PetImages kaggle data folder that can be found here : https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/bhavikjikadara/dog-and-cat-classification-dataset/data
